# PART ONE

# 1. Write a function called 'hello_world' that does not take any arguments and
#    prints "Hello World".

# def hello_world():
#     print "Hello World"


# 2. Write a function called 'say_hi' that takes a name as a string and
#    prints "Hi" followed by the name.

# def say_hi(name):
#     print "Hi {}".format(name)


# 3. Write a function called 'print_product' that takes two integers and multiplies
#    them together. Print the result.




# 4. Write a function called 'repeat_string' that takes a string and an integer and
#    prints the string that many times


# 5. Write a function called 'print_sign' that takes an integer and prints "Higher
#    than 0" if higher than zero and "Lower than 0" if lower
#    than zero. If the integer is 0 print "Zero".


# 6. Write a function called 'is_divisible_by_three' that takes an integer and returns a
#    boolean (True or False), depending on whether the number
#    is evenly divisible by 3.


# 7. Write a function called 'num_spaces' that takes a sentence as one string and
#    returns the number of spaces.


# 8. Write a function called 'total_meal_price' that can be passed a meal price and a
#    tip percentage. It should return the total amount paid
#    (price + price * tip). **However:** passing in the tip
#    percentage should be optional; if not given, it should
#    default to 15%.


# 9. Write a function called 'sign_and_parity' that takes an integer as an argument and
#    returns two pieces of information as strings ---
#    "Positive" or "Negative" and "Even" or "Odd". The two strings
#    should be returned in a list.
#
#    Then, write code that shows the calling of this function
#    on a number and unpack what is returned into two
#    variables --- sign and parity (whether it's even or odd).
#    Print sign and parity.


################################################################################
# PART TWO

# 1. Turn the block of code from the directions into a function.
#    Take a name and a job title as parameters, making it so the
#    job title defaults to "Engineer" if a job title is not passed in.
#    Return the person's title and name in one string.

# 2. Given a recipient name & job title and a sender name,
#    print the following letter:
#
#       Dear JOB_TITLE RECIPIENT_NAME, I think you are amazing!
#       Sincerely, SENDER_NAME.
#
#    Use the function from #1 to construct the full title for the letter's
#    greeting.
