# PART ONE

# 1. Write a function called 'hello_world' that does not take any arguments and
#    prints "Hello World".

def hello_world():
    print "Hello World"


# 2. Write a function called 'say_hi' that takes a name as a string and
#    prints "Hi" followed by the name.

def say_hi(name):
    print "Hi {}".format(name)


# 3. Write a function called 'print_product' that takes two integers and multiplies
#    them together. Print the result.

def print_product(int1, int2):
    print int1 * int2


# 4. Write a function called 'repeat_string' that takes a string and an integer and
#    prints the string that many times

def repeat_string(repeated_string, number):
    print repeated_string * number


# 5. Write a function called 'print_sign' that takes an integer and prints "Higher
#    than 0" if higher than zero and "Lower than 0" if lower
#    than zero. If the integer is 0 print "Zero".

def print_sign(number):
    if number > 0:
        print "Higher than 0"
    elif number < 0:
        print "Lower than 0"
    else:
        print "Zero"


# 6. Write a function called 'is_divisible_by_three' that takes an integer and returns a
#    boolean (True or False), depending on whether the number
#    is evenly divisible by 3.

def is_divisible_by_three(number):
    return (number % 3 == 0)



# 7. Write a function called 'num_spaces' that takes a sentence as one string and
#    returns the number of spaces.

def num_spaces(sentence):
    return len(sentence.split()) - 1


# 8. Write a function called 'total_meal_price' that can be passed a meal price and a
#    tip percentage. It should return the total amount paid
#    (price + price * tip). **However:** passing in the tip
#    percentage should be optional; if not given, it should
#    default to 15%.

def total_meal_price(meal_price, tip_percent = .15):
        total_price = meal_price + (meal_price * tip_percent)
        return total_price


# 9. Write a function called 'sign_and_parity' that takes an integer as an argument and
#    returns two pieces of information as strings ---
#    "Positive" or "Negative" and "Even" or "Odd". The two strings
#    should be returned in a list.
#
#    Then, write code that shows the calling of this function
#    on a number and unpack what is returned into two
#    variables --- sign and parity (whether it's even or odd).
#    Print sign and parity.

def sign_and_parity(number):
    positive_or_negative = None
    even_or_odd = None
    if number < 0:
        positive_or_negative = "Negative"
    else:
        positive_or_negative = "Positive"
    if number % 2 == 0:
        even_or_odd = "Even"
    else:
        even_or_odd = "Odd"
    return [even_or_odd, positive_or_negative]

parity, sign = sign_and_parity(5)
print sign, parity

# PART TWO

# 1. Turn the block of code from the directions into a function.
#    Take a name and a job title as parameters, making it so the
#    job title defaults to "Engineer" if a job title is not passed in.
#    Return the person's title and name in one string.

def full_title(name, job_title = "Engineer"):
        return "{} {}".format(job_title, name)

# 2. Given a recipient name & job title and a sender name,
#    print the following letter:
#
#       Dear JOB_TITLE RECIPIENT_NAME, I think you are amazing!
#       Sincerely, SENDER_NAME.
#
#    Use the function from #1 to construct the full title for the letter's
#    greeting.

def write_letter(name, title, sender):

    print "Dear {}, I think you are amazing! Sincerely, {}".format(full_title(name, title), 
                                                        sender)
