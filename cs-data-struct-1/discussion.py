1.  Assuming there is absolutely no sorting and pulling a cracker is random, 
    pulling a cracker would scale at O(n), where n is the number of crackers in 
    your box. The worst case scenario is that there is NO elephant at all, and you 
    have to look at every cracker.

2. O(1), O(log n), O(n log n), O(n^2), O(2^n)

Stacks and Queues
###########

1.1 A stack. This is a LIFO situation. The last pallet you load, will be 
    the first pallet you pull out when unloading.

1.2 A queue. This is a FIFO situation. The first bottle to be loaded on the 
    assembly line will be the first bottle to receive a cap.

1.3 
This is best solved using stacks. You can use a stack to adjust the equation 
into a more computer readable form called postfix notation: 2 7 4 * + 3 2 / +

(When you encounter a operand, push to output, when you encounter an operator 
or a parenthesis, push to stack if it has higher priority than top stack item. 
If the operand has a lower or equal priority than the top stack item, pop the 
stack and add to output until you operand has higher priority - then add to 
stack. To handle parenthesis: Left parenthesis should have higher priority 
than any other symbol, thus you add it to the stack and only pop if you 
encounter a right parenthesis. Example below)

2 + (7 * 4) - (3 / 2)

2 --> # PUSH to output                                 | output = 2 , stack = []
+ --> # PUSH to stack.                                 | output = 2 , stack = [+]
( --> # PUSH to stack.                                 | output = 2 , stack = [+,(]
7 --> # PUSH to output                                 | output = 2 7 , stack = [+,(]
* --> # PUSH to stack (lower prior than left parenth)  | output = 2 7 , stack = [+,(,*]
4 --> # PUSH to output.                                | output = 2 7 4 , stack = [+,(,*]
) --> # POP stack until find left parenth , pop left 
            parenth, don't add to output.              | output = 2 7 4 * , stack = [+]
- --> # POP stack, '-' is equal prior to '+',push '-'  | output = 2 7 4 * + , stack = [-]
( --> # PUSH to stack.                                 | output = 2 7 4 * + , stack = [-, (]
3 --> # PUSH to output.                                | output = 2 7 4 * + 3 , stack = [-, (]
/ --> # PUSH to stack, lower prior than left parenth   | output = 2 7 4 * + 3 , stack = [-, (, /]
2 --> # PUSH to outputself.                            | output = 2 7 4 * + 3 2 , stack = [-, (, /]
) --> # POP until left parenth.                        | output = 2 7 4 * + 3 2 / , stack = [-]
  --> # POP remaining stack.                           | output = 2 7 4 * + 3 2 / -


Then use an additional stack to compute the expression. If you encounter an 
integer, push it to the stack. When you encounter and operand, pop two off the 
stack, compute using the operand and push the result back onto the stack. 

2.a Queues are appropriate data structures when doing a breadth first search 
    on a tree- when you encounter a node, you enqueue it's children at the end of 
    the line, but you still process the nodes in FIFO order - dequeuing from the 
    front.

2.b Queues are the appropriate data structure when you want to process items 
    in the order in which you received them - for example, a printer will print 
    the first task it receives, however while it's printing that other tasks can 
    enqueue. It will process these tasks in FIFO order. 

3.a Stacks are appropriate data structures whenever you are backtracking, an 
    example of this is an undo button - you undo the most recent action you took. 
    This is LIFO order.

3.b Another use of a stack is in a call stack. When you recurse, every 
    function is added to the stack. When it reaches the base case it begins 
    popping from the stack (i.e LIFO) and tracing back to the beginning. 
    Even non-recursive calls are stored in a stack - this is why you see a trace 
    back when something errors out- it gives you the most recent call, then the 
    call that called that call, etc. 

Linked Lists
1. 
Nodes: 
    apple_node, berry_node, cherry_node
Data:
    apple_node.data = "Apple"
    berry_node.data = "Berry"
    cherry_node.data = "Cherry"
Head:
    apple_node
Tail:
    There is no tail in this diagram
Other attributes:
    head.next = apple_node
    apple_node.next = berry_node
    berry_node.next = cherry_node
    cherry_node.next = None

2. In a singly-linked list, every node only has one pointer, pointing to it's 
   next node. In a doubly-linked list each node has two pointers, one pointing 
   to the previous node and one pointing to the next node.

   Doubly-linked lists consume more space and require more work to maintain
   when performing operations, however they can be more useful if you need
   to be able to traverse in two directions. Removing a node in a doubly linked
   list is easier, as we know the node that precedes it.

3. It is easier to append to a linked list with a tail because linked lists 
   do not have indexes, therefore without a tail we have to walk through each 
   node beginning at the head until node.next is None. This scales terribly at O(n)

Trees

1. Food, Italian, Indian, Mexican, Lasagna, Pizza, Tikka Masala, Saag, Burrito
2. Food, Mexican, Enchiladas, Taco, Burrito, Indian, Saag, Tikka Masala, Italian, 
   Pizza, Sicilian, New York-style, CHICAGO STYLE!


3. A binary tree is a tree where each node has 0 to 2 children. 
   A binary SEARCH tree is a binary tree that has the ordering property that all 
   left descendants have values less than it's parent node and all right 
   descendants have values greater than it's parent node. This must be true for 
   all nodes. If the tree is balanced, the runtime scales at O(log n). 
   However, if the tree is not balanced the runtime scales at O(n).
